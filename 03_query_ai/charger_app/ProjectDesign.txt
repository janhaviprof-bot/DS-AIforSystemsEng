Summary

The GreenCharge Planner uses data from the UK Carbon Intensity API to recommend environmentally friendly charging times for electric vehicles.
The system interprets forecast and actual carbon intensity data to identify low-emission electricity periods throughout the day. It then summarizes and formats this information into clear green charging slots so EV users can schedule charging when grid emissions are lowest.

This tool supports sustainability-conscious users by making carbon-aware decisions simple and actionable.
