# My README Formatting Style

Apply this rule when creating or editing README (and README-style) markdown files so they follow a consistent formatting style.

---

## Headers

- **All section headers must be bold and underlined.**
- Use HTML underline inside bold so headers render as both bold and underlined.

**Correct:**
```markdown
## **<u>Installation</u>**
### **<u>Quick Start</u>**
```

**Avoid:** Plain headers with no bold/underline (e.g. `## Installation`).

---

## Hyperlinks to Referenced Files

- **Every reference to a file (script, config, doc, image) must be a hyperlink.**
- Use relative paths from the README’s location.

**Correct:**
```markdown
See [my_script.py](my_script.py) for the main logic.
Configuration is in [config.yaml](config/config.yaml).
```

**Avoid:** Bare file names like `my_script.py` or `config.yaml` without a link.

---

## Comments and Additional Descriptions

- **Explanatory comments and extra descriptions must be in italics.**

**Correct:**
```markdown
Run the script from the project root. *This ensures relative paths resolve correctly.*
*Optional: you can override the port with an environment variable.*
```

**Avoid:** Long explanatory sentences in plain text when they act as comments or asides.

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

- **Every Mermaid diagram must have a title.**
- Put the title at the top of the diagram block using Mermaid’s title syntax.

**Correct:**
````markdown
```mermaid
---
title: System architecture overview
---
flowchart LR
  A[Client] --> B[API]
  B --> C[Database]
```
````

**Avoid:** Mermaid blocks without a `---` and `title: ...` section.

---

## Table of Contents

- **Every README must include a Table of Contents (TOC) near the top.**
- **TOC entries must be hyperlinks to the corresponding section headings** (anchor links).

**Correct:**
```markdown
# **<u>Project Name</u>**

## **<u>Table of Contents</u>**
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Quick Start](#quick-start)
- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [API Reference](#api-reference)

## **<u>Installation</u>**
...
## **<u>Quick Start</u>**
...
```

- Use anchor links that match the heading text: lowercase, spaces as hyphens, no special characters (e.g. `## **<u>Quick Start</u>**` → `#quick-start`).
- List all major sections (and subsections if you want them in the TOC) with links.

**Avoid:** READMEs without a TOC, or a TOC that lists section names without anchor links.
